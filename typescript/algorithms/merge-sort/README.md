# Merge Sort Algorithm (TypeScript)

## Description

This repository contains a simple implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in **TypeScript**. Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with a time complexity of **O(n log n)** in all cases.

## Features

- **Recursive implementation** of Merge Sort.
- **Merge** helper function that combines two sorted arrays.
- Example usage included to demonstrate the algorithm.

## Algorithm Overview

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that:

1. Divides the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sorts each half.
3. Merges the sorted halves back together into a single sorted array.

## Installation

To use this implementation in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/merge-sort-ts.git
   ```
