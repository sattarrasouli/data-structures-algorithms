# Climbing Stairs

A TypeScript implementation of the **Climbing Stairs** problem using **Dynamic Programming**.

---

## Problem Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.  
Each time you can climb **1 or 2 steps**. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


## Time Complexity
Uses Dynamic Programming (iterative bottom-up approach):

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

## ðŸ§ª Test

To run the test for this algorithm:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/sattarrasouli/data-structures-algorithms.git

# go to directory
cd data-structures-algorithms

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the test for this specific algorithm
npx jest climbingStairs.test.ts

```
