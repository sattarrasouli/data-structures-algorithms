## Description

**Selection Sort** is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.  
It repeatedly finds the **minimum element** from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning.  
Although it's not the most efficient, itâ€™s great for learning the fundamentals of sorting logic.

## ðŸ§ª Test

To run the test for this algorithm:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/sattarrasouli/data-structures-algorithms.git

# Go to directory
cd data-structures-algorithms

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the test for this specific algorithm
npx jest selectionSort.test.ts
```

## Time Complexity:

- Best: O(nÂ²)
- Average: O(nÂ²)
- Worst: O(nÂ²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

Selection Sort performs consistently at O(nÂ²) time complexity because it always goes through the entire array to find the next smallest element, regardless of its initial order.

## Algorithm Overview

Selection Sort works by:

1. Iterating through the array.
2. Finding the smallest element in the unsorted part.
3. Swapping it with the first unsorted element.
4. Repeating until the array is fully sorted.
